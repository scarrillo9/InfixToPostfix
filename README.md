# InfixToPostfix
This program is meant to write a program that, given an arithmetic expression,
 *first transforms it to a postfix form, and then
 *computes its value (by using the stack-based algorithms from class)
It can be assumed that all the numbers are one-digit ones and parenthesis don't have to be taken into consideration.
